# TCP-IP-Vulnerability-analysis
A collection of exercises and processes related to TCP and IP vulnerability analysis.

Since this project is just a matter of carrying out certain vulnerability analysis processes, there isnt much code in this assignment, just a few python scripts for sending packets for specific attacks. The vulnerability analsis report contains processes, wireshark captures, and explanations for each of the exercises.

*All exercises performed were carried out in a contained network of locally hosted virtual machines*
